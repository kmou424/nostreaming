# Development Rules & Specifications

## Tech Stack

- **Runtime**: Bun
- **HTTP Framework**: Elysia
- **Database**: Bun native SQLite (`bun:sqlite`)
- **Configuration**: TOML
- **Frontend**: React + Refine

## Architecture

- **Backend Pattern**: Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

## Project Goal

Build a universal LLM API reverse proxy tool that:

- Supports upstream providers like OpenAI, Google AI Studio, etc.
- Exposes an OpenAI-compatible interface.
- **Pseudo-Streaming Strategy**:
  - Clients connect via streaming (SSE).
  - Backend requests to upstream are _non-streaming_.
  - Backend sends SSE keep-alive packets to the frontend while waiting for the full upstream response.
  - Once upstream responds, the full content is streamed to the client.

## Development Philosophy

- **Restrained Coding**: Implement _only_ what is explicitly requested. Do not over-engineer or add unrequested features.
- **Simplicity**: Prefer simple, native solutions (e.g., Bun's built-in tools) over complex external dependencies where possible.
